## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

This was a great way to test out my typeScript skills. I had one challenge besides getting used to typeScript syntax compared to javaScript, which was how different typeScript project have it for dotenv files and environment variables.

Also, UI is not my strong suit, so the page looks pretty basic.
